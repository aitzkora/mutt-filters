Overview
--------
This is a fork simply adapted to work with ics files coming from Zimbra
Dependancies
------------
Perl modules
    * Data::ICal
    * Text::Autoformat

These are available as Debian packages (in etch at least)
    * libdata-ical-perl
    * libtext-autoformat-perl

Installation
------------
You need something like this in your muttrc ...

autoview text/calendar
alternative_order text/plain text/html text/*

which instructs mutt that the text/calendar MIME type can be automatically
viewed, but you prefer to see text/plain and text/html first.

Lastly, in your mailcap (either /etc/mailcap or ~/.mailcap) you need something
like ...

text/calendar; /path/to/vcalendar-filter; copiousoutput

Any problems/bugs/improvements or feedback of any type is welcome.
